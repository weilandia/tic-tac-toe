#YAML Tic Tac Toe

This project was a response to a challenge to create a tic tac tow game that never loses.  I realize this implementation is not nearly as simple as it could have been using Javascript or a legitimate database, but I purposefully chose to use Sinatra and a YAML database as a learning exercise.

###Play the game:
* clone repo and run 'shotgun' to launch the server
* navigate to localhost:9393

###Run the tests:
* bundle and run 'rake test'
